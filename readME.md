## Coding Together

Learning is most effective when you apply what you've learned. That's why we encourage you to code along with us every step of the way. We'll be working on practical exercises and projects, and you'll have the opportunity to push your code to your GitHub repository and share it with us. This collaborative coding approach will enhance your understanding and help you build a portfolio of real-world projects.
